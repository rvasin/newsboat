# This disables three features, for the following reasons:
# - "suggestions" and "color" features: we provide our own help text, so don't
#   need those
# - "vec_map": this provides "a slight performance improvement" at the cost of
#   an additional dependency. At the time of writing Rust is still a new kid on
#   the block, distros are still figuring out the ways to package crates, so
#   I want as little dependencies as practically possible.
